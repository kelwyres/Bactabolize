# TODO
* Implement parallelised processing
* Warn once when exchange is missing from model
* Draft output
    - optimisiation value
    - command/code to collate all optimisation codes into single table
        - pass/fail, optimisation value, media
* Investigate lack of translations in CDS featuers for reannotated assemblies
* Clean up file i/o in annotation
    - specifically matching ORFs
* Clean up code in general
* Handle spontaneous genes better
* Check required programs are in PATH and have correct versions
* Getting 1182 orthologs on K\_quasi\_quasi\_01A030T, tut notes have 1186
    - 1185 after unannotated gene search (tut detected no annotated genes)
    - resolve differences
* Test BLASTn alignment sequence extraction
    - ensure bounds are correct, no off-by-one errors
